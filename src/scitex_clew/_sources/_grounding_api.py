"""Per-claim grounding verdict — thin public wrapper around ``is_grounded``.

``is_grounded`` (see :mod:`._gate`) is the pure, reusable chain-walk primitive
behind the aggregate verify/export gate: it collapses a claim's provenance
status to a single bool. That is exactly right for ``verify_all_claims``
(which only needs a pass/fail bit to decide an exit code), but WRONG for a
live inline editor (scitex-writer's SSOT paper editor) that needs to tell a
human apart:

* "nothing registered yet" (amber, fine — compose-phase convenience) from
* "a manifest exists and this claim fails it" (red, a real problem)

Collapsing those two into the same ``False`` would misreport a claim's
actual provenance status — the exact bug class this whole feature exists to
prevent. :func:`is_claim_grounded` is the richer, per-claim verdict: the SAME
``grounded`` bool (guaranteed to agree with :func:`~._gate.is_grounded`
bit-for-bit on the same claim/manifest/db whenever a manifest is present —
see the HARD invariant tested in
``tests/scitex_clew/_sources/test__grounding_api.py``), plus a precise
``reason`` + actionable ``fix_hint`` + the matched anchor (if any).

Locked design: agreed with scitex-writer + scitex-dev on 2026-07-08
(scitex-writer ADR 0001 §4 "Inline engine", status Accepted). Tracked by
scitex-todo card ``clew-per-claim-grounding-api``.

    """Per-claim grounding verdict for a live inline editor.

    Resolves ``claim_location`` (a bare ``claim_id`` OR a ``file.tex:L42``
    location — reusing :func:`scitex_clew._claim._model._resolve_claim`, the
    SAME resolution ``verify_claim`` uses) against the clew DB + registered-
    source manifest found under ``workdir``, and returns a richer verdict
    than :func:`~._gate.is_grounded`'s bare bool.

    This function OWNS opening the sources manifest and the clew DB
    internally (via ``workdir``) — callers must never construct a
    ``SourcesManifest`` or a DB handle directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    claim_location : str
        A claim_id or a ``file.tex:L42``-style location.
    workdir : str, optional
        Directory the clew DB + sources manifest are resolved under
        (default ``"."`` — the current working directory, byte-identical to
        every other clew call that resolves implicitly from cwd since
        ``Path(".").resolve()`` is the cwd).

    Notes
    -----
    ``grounded`` NEVER disagrees with the aggregate ``verify_all_claims`` /
    ``export_claims_json`` gate on the same claim: when a manifest is
    present, ``grounded`` is the LITERAL return value of
    :func:`~._gate.is_grounded` (including its defensive-True when the
    manifest has no valid anchors at all — reason folds to ``"grounded"``,
    there is no separate reason for that edge case); when no manifest exists
    at all, the aggregate gate is INACTIVE (it never demotes a claim), so
    ``grounded=True`` here too — reason ``"no_manifest"`` carries the
    "amber, not a failure" nuance the bool alone cannot express.
